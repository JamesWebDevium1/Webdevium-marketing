### Post 2: "10 Performance Tips for Modern Web Apps"

**Excerpt**: "Learn how to optimize your web applications for blazing-fast performance with these proven techniques."

**Content**:
```html
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Performance is crucial for user experience and SEO. Here are 10 tips to make your web apps lightning-fast.</p>

<h2>1. Optimize Images</h2>
<p>Use modern formats like WebP and AVIF. Implement lazy loading for images below the fold. Always specify width and height attributes.</p>

<h2>2. Implement Code Splitting</h2>
<p>Load only the JavaScript needed for each page. Modern frameworks like Next.js handle this automatically.</p>

<h2>3. Use a CDN</h2>
<p>Serve your assets from locations close to your users. Webdevium includes a global CDN by default.</p>

<h2>4. Minimize Third-Party Scripts</h2>
<p>Every external script adds overhead. Audit your dependencies and remove what you don't need.</p>

<h2>5. Enable Compression</h2>
<p>Use Brotli or Gzip compression for text assets. Most hosting platforms enable this by default.</p>

<h2>6. Cache Aggressively</h2>
<p>Implement proper caching headers for static assets. Use stale-while-revalidate for dynamic content.</p>

<h2>7. Optimize Web Fonts</h2>
<p>Use variable fonts when possible. Subset fonts to include only needed characters. Use font-display: swap.</p>

<h2>8. Reduce JavaScript Bundle Size</h2>
<p>Use tree shaking and dead code elimination. Consider switching to lighter alternatives for heavy libraries.</p>

<h2>9. Implement Service Workers</h2>
<p>Cache assets for offline access. Enable faster repeat visits with proper service worker strategies.</p>

<h2>10. Monitor Performance</h2>
<p>Use tools like Lighthouse, WebPageTest, and Chrome DevTools to continuously monitor and improve performance.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Performance optimization is an ongoing process. Start with these tips and measure the impact on your Core Web Vitals.</p>
